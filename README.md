# IMS-DATASET

The data was generated by the NSF I/UCR Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS –
www.imscenter.net) with support from Rexnord Corp. in Milwaukee, WI


- 1 accelerometer for each bearing (4 bearings)
- All failures occurred after exceeding designed life time of
the bearing which is more than 100 million revolutions.

## **Data Structure**

Each data set consists of individual files that are 1-second vibration signal snapshots recorded at specific intervals. Each file consists of 20,480 points with the sampling rate set at 20 kHz. Each record (row) in the data file is a data point.

**Set No. 2:**
